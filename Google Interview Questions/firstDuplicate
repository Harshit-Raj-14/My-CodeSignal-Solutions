/* USING HASHSET */
int solution(int[] arr) {
    HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
    for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
        if(set.contains(arr[i])) return arr[i];
        set.add(arr[i]);
    }
    return -1;
}

LOGIC --- 
we make a hashset. Its proerty is that it can have only unique elemnts and duplicates are delted.
We start putting inside element one by one from array. But when the element is already present in the set that will be the first duplicate.


/* THIS ALSO WORKS BUT DON'T KNOW HOW */
int solution(int[] a) {
    for (int i:a){
        if (a[Math.abs(i)-1]<0) return Math.abs(i);
        a[Math.abs(i)-1]*=-1;
    }
    return -1;
}
