int solution(int a) {
int ans = 0;
  while (a > 0) {
    ans = ans<<1;
    ans = ans | a & 1;
    a = a>>1;
  }
  return ans;
}


QUESTION :
Reverse the order of the bits in a given integer.

Example

    For a = 97, the output should be
    solution(a) = 67.

    97 equals to 1100001 in binary, which is 1000011 after mirroring, and that is 67 in base 10.

    For a = 8, the output should be
    solution(a) = 1.
