int solution(int[] a) {
    int ans=0;
    for(int i=0;i<a.length;i++){
        ans = ans | a[i]<<8*i; 
    }
    return ans;
}

LOGIC - 
We are asked to put arrays element in binary form's first 8 bits from starting on the rightmostpart of ans.
So, what's happening here is
Loop1 : ans | a[0]<<0
Loop2 : ans | a[1]<<8
Loop 3 : ans | a[2]<<16
Loop 4 : ans | a[3]<<24
If there had bene only three elmenet sthen the remaing part of ans would have been 0 bits. No problem.

NOTE - That we have not been told that array has exactly 4 element sbut maximum 4elements and could be less.
If it had bene that there were exactly four elements we could have done - return a[3]<<24 | a[2]<<16 | a[1]<<8 | a[0];
